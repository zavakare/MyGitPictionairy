Steps for stand alone voice recognition

I had an error about not finding my .dic and .lm in /pocketsphinx-5prealpha/model/lm/  so I copied them and made directories and lm.  


 


The audio error below , it thought this was solution so I did: 


Sudo nano asound.conf and added the text shown in website above.

error while loading shared libraries: libpocketsphinx.so.3  


Read somewhere :error while loading shared libraries: libpocketsphinx.so.3  


 


Reading about ldconfig: 


The list of directories to be searched is stored in the file /etc/ld.so.conf. Many Red Hat-derived distributions don't normally include /usr/local/lib in the file /etc/ld.so.conf. I consider this a bug, and adding /usr/local/lib to /etc/ld.so.conf is a common ``fix'' required to run many programs on Red Hat-derived systems. 


 


So I thought of doing ldconfig but it didn’t work so I did sudo lsconfig

Error ====error opening audio device device default for capture: no such file or directory FATAL: "continuous.c" , line 245:Failed to open audio device  


Somewhere else I read I needed to execute: sudo apt-get –purge to uninstall  


This helped :sudo apt-get update  


sudo apt-get install pulseaudio  


sudo apt-get install libpulse-dev  


sudo apt-get install osspd  


 


 


Trying to figure out how to make my bash file :(working on now)

FOR MY INFO: 


Acoustic Model: -An acoustic model is used in Automatic Speech Recognition to represent the relationship between an audio signal and the phonemes or other linguistic units that make up speech. The model is learned from a set of audio recordings and their corresponding transcripts. created by taking audio recordings of speech, and their text transcriptions, and using software to create statistical representations of the sounds that make up each word.
