Pictionary is a team game where there is a person who draws a picture based on a randomly assigned word and a teammate tries to guess what they are drawing within an allotted time frame.  Our adaptation, called pictionAIRy, will put a new twist to this classic game.  Instead of drawing on a white board, the player will draw in the air with their hand toward a webcam and motion detection will detect the hand motions of the player and draw them on the screen. 

Functionality:
*	Library of categories and words/phrases to be drawn 
*	Players will create custom profiles using their names and pictures (taken using webcam). Players may choose to make their own teams or may choose for the computer to shuffle the players into respective teams.
*	The game will randomly select which player (Player #1) will draw for their team. They will approach a small touch screen which will contain the word/phrase they will be drawing.
*	Player #1 will put on a tracking object (see photos below) around their fingers. This will allow for their drawing strokes to be tracked. The tracking object will be a neon pink colored circle.
*	Once Player #1 is ready, they press the start button on the touch screen and will draw the given word/phrase toward the webcam in the air. 
*	Player #1's drawing will appear on the computer monitor.
* Player #1's fellow team members must guess the correct word/phrase in 45 seconds. A timer will count down on the screens from 45 seconds.
*	When Player #1's fellow team members are ready to guess the word/phrase, they will hit a buzzer. They will then have 10 seconds to say their guess. The team only gets one guess within the 45 seconds. If no guess is made within the 45 seconds, the team forfeits their turn.
*	If a given answer is correct, the team will be given a point. If the team guesses incorrectly, the opposing team has the opportunity to steal the point away by guessing the phrase based on what has already been drawn. The opposing team will have 10 seconds to confer and make their guess.
*	Guesses will be checked using voice recognition.
*	By default, the game repeats for 3 rounds, where each team gets to draw and guess once per round. The team with the highest number of points at the end of round 3 wins. Teams have the opportunity to customize the number of rounds in the game as well.
