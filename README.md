Pictionary is a team game where there is a person who draws a picture based on a randomly assigned word and a teammate tries to guess what they are drawing within an allotted time frame.  Our adaptation, called pictionAIRy, will put a new twist to this classic game.  Instead of drawing on a white board, the player will draw in the air with their hand toward a webcam and motion detection will detect the hand motions of the player and draw them on the screen. 

Functionality:
*	Library of categories and words/phrases to be drawn 
*	Players will create 2 teams containing 2 players each.
*	The game will randomly select which player (Player #1) will draw for their team. They will approach a small touch screen which will contain the word/phrase they will be drawing.
*	Player #1 will use a tracking object (orange ball). This will allow for their drawing strokes to be tracked. 
*	Once Player #1 is ready, they press the start button on the game display and will draw the given word/phrase toward the webcam in the air. 
*	Player #1's drawing will appear on the computer monitor.
* Player #1's fellow team members must guess the correct word/phrase in 45 seconds. A timer will count down on the screens from 45 seconds.
*	When Player #1's fellow team members are ready to guess the word/phrase, they will hit a buzzer. They will then have 10 seconds to say their guess. The team only gets one guess within the 45 seconds. If no guess is made within the 45 seconds, the team forfeits their turn.
* If Player #1's team members know the answer before time is up, they may press a button.
*	If a given answer is correct, the team will be given a point. If the team guesses incorrectly, they will not be given a point.
*	The game repeats for 4 rounds. The team with the highest number of points at the end of 4 rounds wins.
